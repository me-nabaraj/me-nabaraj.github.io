Each tale was more gripping than the last, and the audience hung.......... <span data-answer="on his words"><button>with his words</button> <button>on his words</button> <button>to his words</button> <button>by his words</button></span>.

            One of the listeners asked, "You sailed across the Atlantic.......... <span data-answer="didn't you"><button>haven't you</button> <button>don't you</button> <button>didn't you</button> <button>won't you</button></span>?"

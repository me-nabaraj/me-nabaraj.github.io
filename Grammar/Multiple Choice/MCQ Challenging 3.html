            I had never seen.......... <span data-answer="an"> <button>a</button> <button>an</button> <button>the</button> <button>x</button></span> elephant that big. It was standing.......... <span data-answer="on"> <button>at</button> <button>in</button> <button>on</button> <button>to</button></span> the road, blocking the way completely. I was unsure.......... <span data-answer="whom"> <button>who</button> <button>where</button> <button>which</button> <button>whom</button></span> to call, but decided to contact the zoo immediately.

            The zoo staff.......... <span data-answer="arrived"> <button>arrives</button> <button>arrived</button> <button>has arrived</button> <button>will arrive</button></span> promptly, and they quickly managed to calm the elephant. The people gathered around.......... <span data-answer="were amazed"> <button>were amazed</button> <button>are amazed</button> <button>have amazed</button> <button>amaze</button></span> at the sight of such a majestic creature.

            If they.......... <span data-answer="hadn’t arrived"> <button>don’t arrive</button> <button>didn’t arrive</button> <button>hadn’t arrived</button> <button>won’t arrive</button></span> quickly, the situation could have become more dangerous. 
 
            When asked about the elephant’s behavior, the zookeeper explained that it.......... <span data-answer="was brought"> <button>is brought</button> <button>was brought</button> <button>had brought</button> <button>has been brought</button></span> to the zoo after being rescued from the wild. 

            If animals are treated with care, they adapt better to their new environment, ..........? <span data-answer="don't they"> <button>do they</button> <button>don't they</button> <button>did they</button> <button>didn't they</button></span>. 

            "Do you think it will ever return to the wild?" asked one of the visitors. "I’m not sure," replied the zookeeper, "........... <span data-answer="but"> <button>because</button> <button>and</button> <button>but</button> <button>so</button></span>, if it is made to feel comfortable, there’s a possibility."

                      
            The whole experience was an eye-opener, and it made me.......... <span data-answer="think"> <button>thinking</button> <button>think</button> <button>to think</button> <button>thought</button></span> about how we should treat wild animals in captivity.
